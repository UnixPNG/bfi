# bfi
Brainf*ck interpreter written in Rust

important: the 1st character in the file doesnt get parsed if you have an input character
im not sure why
might be something with the remove whitespace function

i started writing this at like 9 pm and i finished at 11:15pm 

notes:
you cant have a loop in a loop in a loop because i didnt write that yet

you can however have a loop in a loop
